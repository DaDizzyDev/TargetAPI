**What is Target API?**
Target API is a free and simple discord bot API. You can download this, configurate and add your commands way easier then any other API such as discord.js.
This merges both custom source and discord.js source to make it easier to create your discord bot to make life easier.

**Why us?**
We are super simple meaning its easy to setup your discord bot and get it running in no time!

**Give it a go!**
Even if you dont want to use something that simple, its fully open source meaning you can modify it to your liking. Even if you dont like it you can switch back.
This was made for new people to create bots or to create them simply.

**Credits.**
I do *not* take credits for the API fully. A lot of the stuff on here wasnt developed from me but are open source such as discord.js, fs etc.

***Enjoy using Target API!***
